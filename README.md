# what-time-to-post
I recommend to users what time is best for posting to a popular website to maximize engagement.

In this project...

- I set a goal. (i.e. define my research questions)

- I collected and sorted the data.

- I reformatted and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.

- I analyzed the data.

More specifically...

- I removed Headers from a List of Lists.

- I extracted Ask HN and Show HN Posts.

- I calculated the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN and Show HN Posts.

- I found the Amount of Ask Posts and Comments by Hour Created.

- I calculated the Average Number of Comments for Ask HN Posts by Hour.

- I sorted and printed Values from a List of Lists.

Some potential next steps are:

- I could determine if show or ask posts receive more points on average.

- I could determine if posts created at a certain time are more likely to receive more points.

- I could compare my results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
